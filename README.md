# CobolLoader
You read the title right - intro to text parsing and difference between positional (string, array loops) and regex parsering of text. 
With some standard CSV used to explain packaging (and the build-ing of libarys).

Needs some gramer fixs and comments added (used in school project to alow students to learn Git/Github).

Used as a teaching example of regex with Java - not meant as efficient model.
